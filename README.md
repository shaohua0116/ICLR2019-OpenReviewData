## Descriptions

This Jupyter Notebook contains the data and visualizations that are crawled ICLR 2019 OpenReview webpages. As some of the reviews are still missing (1.0061\% by the time the data is crawled), the results might not be accurate.  All the crawled data (sorted by the average ratings) can be found [here](#Data).

## Prerequisites

- Python3.5
- [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
- [pyvirtualdisplay](https://pypi.org/project/PyVirtualDisplay/) (run on a headless device)
- [wordcloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/)
- [imageio](https://imageio.github.io/)

## Visualizations 


The word clouds formed by keywords of submissions show the hot topics including **reinforcement learning**, **generative adversarial networks**, **generative models**, **imitation learning**, **representation learning**, etc.
<p align="center">
    <img src="asset/wordcloud.png" width="720"/>
</p>

This figure is plotted with python [word cloud generator](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) 

```python
from wordcloud import WordCloud
wordcloud = WordCloud(max_font_size=64, max_words=160, 
                      width=1280, height=640,
                      background_color="black").generate(' '.join(keywords))
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation="bilinear")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

The distributions of reviewer ratings center around 5 to 6 (mean: 5.15).

<p align="center">
    <img src="asset/rating.png" width="640"/>
</p>

You can compute how many papers are beaten by yours with

```python
def PR(rating_mean, your_rating):
    pr = np.sum(your_rating >= np.array(rating_mean))/len(rating_mean)*100
    return pr
my_rating = (5+6+7)/3  # your average rating here
print('Your papar beats {:.2f}% of submission '
      '(well, jsut based on the ratings...)'.format(PR(rating_mean, my_rating)))
# ICLR 2017: accept rate 39.1% (198/507) (15 orals and 183 posters)
# ICLR 2018: accept rate 32% (314/981) (23 orals and 291 posters)
# ICLR 2018: accept rate ?% (?/1580)
```

The top 50 common keywords and their frequency.

</p>

The average reviewer ratings and the frequency of keywords indicate that to maximize your chance to get higher ratings would be using the keywords such as **theory**, **robustness**, or **graph neural network**.

## How it works

See [How to install Selenium and ChromeDriver on Ubuntu](#Install).

To crawl data from dynamic websites such as OpenReview, a headless web simulator is created by

```
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
executable_path = '/Users/waltersun/Desktop/chromedriver'  # path to your executable browser
options = Options()
options.add_argument("--headless")
browser = webdriver.Chrome(options=options, executable_path=executable_path)  
```

Then, we can get the content of a webpage

```
browser.get(url)
```

To know what content we can crawl, we will need to inspect the webpage layout.

<p align="center">
    <img src="asset/inspect.png" width="720"/>
</p>

I chose to get the content by

```
key = browser.find_elements_by_class_name("note_content_field")
value = browser.find_elements_by_class_name("note_content_value")
```

The data includes the abstract, keywords, TL; DR, comments.

## <a id="Install"></a>Installing Selenium and ChromeDriver on Ubuntu
The following content is hugely borrowed from a nice [post](https://christopher.su/2015/selenium-chromedriver-ubuntu/) written by Christopher Su.

- Install Google Chrome for Debian/Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install libxss1 libappindicator1 libindicator7
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

- Install `xvfb` to run Chrome on a headless device

```
sudo apt-get install xvfb
```

- Install ChromeDriver for 64-bit Linux

```
sudo apt-get install unzip  # If you don't have unzip package

wget -N http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.26/chromedriver_linux64.zip
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
chmod +x chromedriver

sudo mv -f chromedriver /usr/local/share/chromedriver
sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/chromedriver /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
```

If your system is 32-bit, please find the ChromeDriver releases [here](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/) and modify the above download command.

- Install Python dependencies (Selenium and pyvirtualdisplay)

```
pip install pyvirtualdisplay selenium
```

- Test your setup in Python

```python
from pyvirtualdisplay import Display
from selenium import webdriver

display = Display(visible=0, size=(1024, 1024))
display.start()
browser = webdriver.Chrome()
browser.get('http://shaohua0116.github.io/')
print(browser.title)
print(browser.find_element_by_class_name('bio').text)
```
